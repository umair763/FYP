this is not correct let me repeat my idea , it is a social media management platform which will allow small and medium businesses and individual content creates to manage their posts and videos for example a startup has to make same video with same description on facebook,Instagram youtube etc it is a redendent and hectic process for ease our platform will do this on single touch  with ease, our project will also track posts reaction such as reactions, comments, reach, and shares then do a cross comparison between same post on different social app such as a post on facebook vs Instagram (any vs any), also creating a report and notifying user on top reach of a post another feature of our project will be scheduling of posts and AI integration for sentimental analysis through comments of a posts(image/video on any platform) to analyse for positive and negative comments other feature will be modularity such as AI extension interoperability with Wordpress, it will also include a achievement rewards such as a bar or any sort of graphic that will show user progress on social media to engage user like a scheduling a post more then 3 times a reward will be given such as scheduling master and posting continuly throughout the week a streak legend reward will be assigned (note gimme some other small to large idea for this project to make it more powerful increase chances of approval within the scope),
